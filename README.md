🔍 Overview

RL-Chat is a conversational AI system that integrates reinforcement learning principles to improve large language model (LLM) responses based on feedback signals.

The project explores how conversational quality can be enhanced through reward modelling, feedback loops and iterative policy optimisation. It demonstrates applied reinforcement learning concepts within a practical chatbot framework.

🎯 Objectives

- Build an interactive LLM-based chat system

- Integrate feedback-driven optimisation

- Simulate reinforcement learning from feedback

- Improve response relevance and coherence over time

- Demonstrate RLHF-style architecture principles
